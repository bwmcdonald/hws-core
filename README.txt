This directory and its subdirectories contain the HWS-Core infrastructure, a
ColdFusion package that supports all the other open source applications developed
by Warren Hunting Smith Library.


Installation

To install HWS-Core, download the entire directory structure into a folder on
a web server running ColdFusion (initially developed on CF8 and tested on CF10).
Review init.cfg in the /init/ directory; then open /init/init.cfm in a web
browser. After completing installation, remove the hws-core directory from the
web server.
